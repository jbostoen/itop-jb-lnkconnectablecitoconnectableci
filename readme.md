## What?

This class is very similar to the lnkConnectableCIToNetworkDevice.
However, with this implementation, ConnectableCI should be linkable to other ConnectableCIs.
(ConnectableCI = parent of DatacenterDevices such as NAS, NetworkDevice, Server, SANSwitch, StorageSystem, TypeLibrary...)

Additional info can be added, such as:

* **comment**
* **link type** (USB 3.0, RJ45, optical fibre single or multi mode, ...)
* **patch label**


‚ö† This alters default iTop classes.
In the "Network devices" tab of a Connectable CI, it replaces Link Connectable CI / Network Device.
In the "Devices" tab of a Network Device, it replaces Link Connectable CI / Network Device.
It doesn't remove this old class though!

With some work (for example CSV export/import), you can copy most of your old data from the lnkConnectableCIToNetworkDevice to lnkConnectableCIToConnectableCI.


## Cookbook

XML:
* add a new class

## Upgrade notes

If you used the jb-ipdevices class before, you can run this query on your database:
```
use itop;
UPDATE lnkconnectablecitoconnectableci 
SET device1_id = connectableci_id, device1_port = device_port, device2_Id = networkdevice_id, device2_port = network_port
```
